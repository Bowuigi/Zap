# Zap

A lightning fast AUR searcher (might evolve into a helper)

Installation
------------

Just place the `zap` program somewhere on your **PATH**

Usage
-----

Any of

```sh
zap search [package]
```

```sh
zap search
```

The second one asks for a package too, but on **stdin** instead of **arg**

There is also an experimental Package info command, to use it do

```sh
zap info [package]
```

or, to read from **stdin**

```sh
zap info
```

Be aware that it might have bugs or not work on some cases
