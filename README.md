# Zap

A lightning fast AUR searcher (might evolve into a helper)

Installation
------------

Just place the `zap` program somewhere on your **PATH**, or use the install.sh script which will place it in /usr/local/bin.

Usage
-----


```sh
zap search [package]
```

```sh
zap search
```

The second one asks for a package too, but on **stdin** instead of **arg**

There is also a package info command, to use it do

```sh
zap info [package]
```

or, to read from **stdin**

```sh
zap info
```


To provide basic usage commands, use

```sh
zap help
```

Be aware that it might have bugs or not work on some cases
